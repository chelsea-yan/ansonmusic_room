            <div class="lyric-text">I never meant to let you down
It's a hell of a road I led you down
And my heart's beating out of my chest
And your hand is in my hand
But it's getting late, gotta get it out

It would be easier to lie
But I really hope that you'll see in time

Sometimes loving means leaving
Sometimes people need healing
Sometimes there's no good way
To make a wrong thing right
Some things change with the seasons
Sometimes the heart has its reasons
Yeah, sometimes what's good is goodbye

You probably think it was easy for me
Like you don't play the lead in all of my dreams
Like I don't wake up almost every day
With a tear—stained pillow case
But I'm not trying to make it all about me

Maybe I should have lied
'Cause god, it just hurts on the other side

Sometimes loving means leaving
Sometimes people need healing
Sometimes there's no good way
To make a wrong thing right
Some things change with the seasons
Sometimes the heart has its reasons
Yeah, sometimes what's good is goodbye

There's a universe where this could've worked
And I wish we were in it
'Cause all I know is I broke your heart
And I wish that I didn't

But sometimes loving means leaving
Sometimes people need healing
Sometimes there's no good way
To make a wrong thing right
And some things change with the seasons
Sometimes the heart has its reasons
Yeah, sometimes what's good is goodbye
