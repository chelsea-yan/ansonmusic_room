We were floating for days
We were flying the way
That doves do
And I loved you
We were sailing the sky
Watching the clouds passing by
Like a dreamland, where should we land?
Yeah, we were invincible
That's what they said
So indivisible
Wherever we went
Higher and higher, yeah
I guess that we had it all
Light up the sky and then
We thought that we'd never fall
You were my Hindenburg lover, we were flying away
Then we took a wrong turn and it was all up in flames
And now I'm staring at the wreckage tryin' to make it okay
Oh, yeah
And I guess I got burned from the scars on my heart
And I'd be lyin' if I said I didn't know from the start
That there was something in between us that would tear us apart
Oh, yeah
I can still see your face
Looking back through the flames
And I search it
Was it worth it?
No I don't mind the smoke
But your tears make me choke
Are you okay? Should I go away?
Yeah, we were invincible
That's what they said
So indivisible
Wherever we went
Higher and higher, yeah
We thought that we'd never fall
Light up the sky and then
I guess that we had it all
You were my Hindenburg lover we were flying away
But then we took a wrong turn and it was all up in flames
And now I'm staring at the wreckage tryin' make it okay
Oh, yeah
And I guess I got burned from the scars on my heart
And I'd be lying if I said I didn't know from the start
That there was something in between us that would keep us apart
Oh, yeah
You were my Hindenburg lover we were flying away

Oh, yeah
