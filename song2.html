            <div class="lyric-text">I’m across the pond again
A new start, new chapter for this American, hmm
And I’m back here in Kensington
Same rain, new face to make some memories with, hmm

She’s on my lips
But you’re on my heart
I tell her “I’m fine”
I’m falling apart
And she’s in my bed
But you’re in my dreams
You won’t let me rest
Even in my sleep

You know that London’s so much colder now that you went away
You took my favorite city and you painted it gray
I thought that I could bring the color back with somebody new
Oh, but even with the accent, I just wish she was you
I just wish she was you
Hmm, hmm

I’m on the train again
New ticket, same old destination, hmm
Hyde Park and the West End
Try not to think back to that night we went
But I just can’t forget

She’s on my lips
But you’re on my heart
I tell her “I’m fine”
I’m falling apart
She’s in my arms
But you’re in my speech
I still hear your words
In the way that I speak

You know that London’s so much colder now that you went away
You took my favorite city and you painted it gray
I thought that I could bring the color back with somebody new
Oh, but even with the accent, I just wish she was you

I just wish she would call me when I can’t sleep at night
I wish she could melt me with that look in her eyes
I wish I was happy, I wish she was enough
But when we’re together, I just wish it was us

You know that London’s so much colder now that you went away
You took my favorite city and you painted it gray
I thought that I could bring the color back with somebody new
Oh, but even with the accent, I just wish she was you
I just wish she was you

Hmm, hmm, hmm
I just wish she was you
Hmm, hmm, hmm
I just wish she was you</div>
